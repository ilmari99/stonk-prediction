Notes 24.11.

Data Pretreatment (Akseli)
- Outlier removal
- Timedelta calculation
- Price differences


Architecture: (Ilmari)
Bidirectional LSTM (Make sure it doesn't use future values)
- Input: Delta values, timedelta
- Output: Binary and delta -> Use binary to get the confidence of up/down

Input -> LSTM -> DENSE -> Number of stocks -> Y -> Confidence




Results evaluation (Sergio)
- Precision and recall
- How much money we actually make?


Optimization of the model (Sergio)
- Ablations: try without Timedelta
- Sensitivity: Try without taking out the outliers and then create synthetic data with economical crisis


Work division
